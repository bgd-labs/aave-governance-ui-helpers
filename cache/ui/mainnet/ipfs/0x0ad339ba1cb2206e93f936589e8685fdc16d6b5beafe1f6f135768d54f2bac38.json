  "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nProposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates, compensating them with GHO, associated with their governance activity during Q3 and Q4 2025 ( From 2025-07-01, last date, until 2025-12-31). The reason is because extending period coverage will bring more reliance and predictability for delegates platform.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOrbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization & diversity of the Aave DAO. This compensation allows them to focus on Aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a both Q3 and Q4 2025, from 2025-07-01 to 2025-12-31.\n\nAs a reminder from previous Orbit round, a new cutoff had been set, starting at [AIP 224](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=224&ipfsHash=0xa4da1c686491e35541aa7e2659d55d0b93e395a89d1b268981aec3b8b2227bc1), to apply again previous rules of a minimum of 20k voting power and 85% vote ratio on all Snapshots and AIP to be considered eligible to Orbit.\n\nFrom now on, Orbit period coverage will be semi-annually or 2 times per year (Q1 and Q2 together, and Q3 and Q4 together), with the aim of reducing governance bloat.\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Period Coverage:** Q3 and Q4 2025 from 2025-07-01 2025 to 2025-12-31\n- **Eligible Platforms:**\n  - EzR3al: [0x8659d0bb123da6d16d9394c7838ba286c2207d0e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8659d0bb123da6d16d9394c7838ba286c2207d0e)\n  - stablelabs: [0xecc2a9240268bc7a26386ecb49e1befca2706ac9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xecc2a9240268bc7a26386ecb49e1befca2706ac9)\n  - IgnasDefi: [0x3DDC7d25c7a1dc381443e491Bbf1Caa8928A05B0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3DDC7d25c7a1dc381443e491Bbf1Caa8928A05B0)\n- **Budget:** 90,000 GHO\n- **Relevant Links:**\n  - [ACI’s Orbit tracker](https://dapps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\nAs a reminder, Service Providers will not be considered eligible to Orbit Program.\n\nFunds are distributed based on 180 days, as seen on budget and as specified on motivation section.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe ACI is independent and has not received any form of compensation from related parties for the drafting of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV3EthereumLido](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/abd1836e055bb5afeea756cbcb7e4260f72e5d9a/src/20251103_AaveV3EthereumLido_OrbitRenewal/AaveV3EthereumLido_OrbitRenewal_20251103.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV3EthereumLido](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/abd1836e055bb5afeea756cbcb7e4260f72e5d9a/src/20251103_AaveV3EthereumLido_OrbitRenewal/AaveV3EthereumLido_OrbitRenewal_20251103.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-orbit-program-renewal-q3-and-q4-2025/23289)\n- [Discussion](https://snapshot.org/#/s:aavedao.eth/proposal/0x4f2381126a2ddf4073916bbdd6d25b031c2dabd022d23887cee6f315693fd7c4)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
