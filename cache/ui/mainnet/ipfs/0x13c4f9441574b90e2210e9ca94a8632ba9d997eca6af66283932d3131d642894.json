  "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal will upgrade all active Aave instances to version v3.3.0.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBack in December, we (BGD Labs) [presented](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-3-feat-umbrella/20129) the Aave v3.3.0 upgrade, improving Aave's liquidation engine, and supporting the previously proposed [Umbrella](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-umbrella/18366).\nWith the proposal being executed, the Aave Protocol will start tracking bad debt, which can then be used as an input on Umbrella to slash stakers & cover the realized deficit.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal will upgrade all active Aave instances to the new v3.3.0 version.\nIn practice this means:\n\n1. The pool implementation will be upgraded via a call to `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolImpl(newImpl)`\n2. The pool configurator will be upgraded via a call to `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolConfiguratorImpl(poolConfiguratorImpl)`\n3. The pool data provider will be replaced via a call to `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolDataProvider(newPoolDataProvider)`\n\nIn addition the proposal will transfer 66.400$ in aUSDC to a wallet controlled by BGD to cover audit costs, as disclosed [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-3-feat-umbrella/20129/5)\n\n## Security procedures\n\nThe v3.3.0 upgrade was audited by:\n\n- [StErMi](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-origin/blob/v3.3.0/audits/2024-10-22_StErMi_Aave-v3.3.pdf)\n- [Certora](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-origin/blob/v3.3.0/audits/2024-11-07_Certora_Aave-v3.3.0.pdf)\n- [Oxorio](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-origin/blob/v3.3.0/audits/2025-01-29_Oxorio_Aave-v3.3.0.pdf)\n\nIn addition a [Sherlock Audit Contest](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-aave-v3-3-sherlock-contest/20498/2) was performed from `13.01.25 - 22.01.25`.\nYou can find the related audit report [here](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/v3.3.0/audits/2025-01-22_Sherlock_Aave-v3.3.0.pdf).\n\n## References\n\n- [Implementation](https://github.com/bgd-labs/protocol-v3.3-upgrade/blob/main/src/contracts/UpgradePayload.sol)\n- [Tests](https://github.com/bgd-labs/protocol-v3.3-upgrade/tree/main/tests)\n- [Diffs](https://github.com/bgd-labs/protocol-v3.3-upgrade/tree/main/diffs)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-3-feat-umbrella/20129)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
