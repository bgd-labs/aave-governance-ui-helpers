Following our observations and simulations, we believe increasing the LT and LTV for this market is prudent.\n\nsAVAX's average market cap over the past 180 days is $257M, and its daily average volume is $3.1M. It has registered a daily annualized volatility of 90.88%, a 30-day annualized volatility of 74.11%, and its largest single-day price drop was 14.5%.\n\nIts supply is well distributed, with all but two of the top 10 suppliers leveraging the asset with WAVAX.\n\nSupply has been trending upward since the end of July.\n\n95.6% of the value of assets borrowed against sAVAX is WAVAX in E-Mode. USDC is the most popular non-E-Mode asset borrowed.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend increasing sAVAX’s LTV and LT and increasing its LTV in E-Mode by a small amount.\n\n| Asset | Chain     | Market | Current LTV | Recommended LTV | Current LT | Recommended LT |\n| ----- | --------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------- |\n| sAVAX | Avalanche | Main   | 40%         | 50%             | 45%        | 55%            |\n| sAVAX | Avalanche | E-Mode | 92.5%       | 93%             | 95%        | -              |\n| WAVAX | Avalanche | E-Mode | 92.5%       | 93%             | 95%        | -              |\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV3Avalanche](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/e87585b08712d5df242eb2efabcde526f67a32df/src/20240920_AaveV3Avalanche_ChaosLabsRiskParameterUpdatesSAVAXLTLTVAdjustment/AaveV3Avalanche_ChaosLabsRiskParameterUpdatesSAVAXLTLTVAdjustment_20240920.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV3Avalanche](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/e87585b08712d5df242eb2efabcde526f67a32df/src/20240920_AaveV3Avalanche_ChaosLabsRiskParameterUpdatesSAVAXLTLTVAdjustment/AaveV3Avalanche_ChaosLabsRiskParameterUpdatesSAVAXLTLTVAdjustment_20240920.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x79d53b646cbada43fca9468df9c9ecbbaab42f9f4f17691cbdf216b21f6c21bb)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-savax-lt-ltv-adjustment/18995)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
