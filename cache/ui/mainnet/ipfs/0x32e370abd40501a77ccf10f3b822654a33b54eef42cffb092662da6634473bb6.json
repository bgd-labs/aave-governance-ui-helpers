  "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) Phase VII Funding request. Since the last update in April, GHO has experienced significant growth across supply, integrations, and ecosystem adoption. This proposal seeks to sustain and accelerate that momentum while lowering the overall budget requirements compared to the previous phase.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince Phase VI, GHO has grown significantly, from 200M to over 315M supply, while maintaining a strong peg. The ALC has driven this expansion through liquidity programs, GSM adjustments, and integrations across DeFi and CeFi (notably Fluid deployments on Base and Arbitrum, as well as GHO’s first CEX listing on Bitget).\n\nPhase VII aims to:\n\nSustain ongoing growth of GHO while optimizing cost efficiency.\n\nProvide the ALC with sufficient resources to support integrations, market stability, and ecosystem expansion.\n\nReduce overall funding requirements compared to Phase VI, reflecting the increasing maturity of GHO and the compounding efficiency of incentives as supply scales.\n\n## Specification\n\nCreate an allowance enabling the ALC to withdraw 2,500,000 aEthLidoGHO from the Prime instance.\n\nThis represents a reduction from Phase VI’s budget, reflecting both the maturity of GHO and the DAO’s other growth priorities. The lower budget is designed to balance sustaining ongoing initiatives with funding new integrations on emerging networks.\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b#code\nALC Ethereum SAFE: 0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/c2687ffde3d62d7e55a1e3c3ed076ec17b1af4e2/src/20250930_AaveV3Ethereum_AaveLiquidityCommitteeFundingPhaseVII/AaveV3Ethereum_AaveLiquidityCommitteeFundingPhaseVII_20250930.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/c2687ffde3d62d7e55a1e3c3ed076ec17b1af4e2/src/20250930_AaveV3Ethereum_AaveLiquidityCommitteeFundingPhaseVII/AaveV3Ethereum_AaveLiquidityCommitteeFundingPhaseVII_20250930.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:aavedao.eth/proposal/0x2d105bc85e7805faa1d43e8a069b5c1ae2ee792d6f80cb62ce0e2aeb5b75d713)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-liquidity-committee-funding-phase-vii/23143)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
