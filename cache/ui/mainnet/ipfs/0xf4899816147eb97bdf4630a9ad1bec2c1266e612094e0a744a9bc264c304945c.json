In addition to those, and similar to how we proposed back in [Aave v3.1 with Cantina](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-aave-3-1-cantina-competition/17485), we think due to the nature of this upgrade it can be pretty positive to have an open security contest to maximize the numbers of experts looking for any type of problem in the codebase.\n\nEven if the experience and [outcome](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/audits/02-06-2024-Cantina-contest-AaveV3.1.pdf) with Cantina was pretty positive, part of our security approach is to try different providers, whenever they look solid quality-wise, and/or introduce new mechanics, like in the case of Sherlock.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe high-level structure of the contest can be found on the Aave governance forum [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-aave-v3-3-sherlock-contest/20498#p-51858-specification-3).\n\nThis proposal releases the budget required for the contest from the Aave Collector:\n\n- 30'000 USDC to BGD Labs, to refund the part advanced to Sherlock post-ARFC (transaction [HERE](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x396995576313b6578dad47d0ef7ab454b9840c246262bb812a078a092158b058)).\n- 200'000 USDC to Sherlock, to cover the rest of the contest budget.\n\n| **Entity** | **Recipient Address**                      | **Value**    |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |\n| BGD Labs   | 0xb812d0944f8F581DfAA3a93Dda0d22EcEf51A9CF | 30'000 USDC  |\n| Sherlock   | 0x666B8EbFbF4D5f0CE56962a25635CfF563F13161 | 200'000 USDC |\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/29ee27b76f4a86e9f213ed430f4df90547e74c39/src/20250106_AaveV3Ethereum_AaveV33SherlockContestFunding/AaveV3Ethereum_AaveV33SherlockContestFunding_20250106.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/29ee27b76f4a86e9f213ed430f4df90547e74c39/src/20250106_AaveV3Ethereum_AaveV33SherlockContestFunding/AaveV3Ethereum_AaveV33SherlockContestFunding_20250106.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:aave.eth/proposal/0x8c04404012d9b74c3e7cebff2ddff3c9d40a280b4cfa7c2fca42be2a59b005ee)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-aave-v3-3-sherlock-contest/20498)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
