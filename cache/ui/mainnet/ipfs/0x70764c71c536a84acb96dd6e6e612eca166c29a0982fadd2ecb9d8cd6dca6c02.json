  "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nDo a fire drill voting flow with a mock governance proposal using Avalanche as the voting network instead of Polygon as usual, to test that all peripheral systems are properly functioning.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing the same rationale as [the previous proposed fire drill using Ethereum as voting network](https://governance.aave.com/t/technical-maintenance-proposals/15274/91), we think it is beneficial to do the same with Avalanche, the other available network in production, but that has never been used, given that Polygon has worked properly.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe governance proposal will be created using the [Ethereum â†’ Avalanche Voting Portal](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9Ded9406f088C10621BE628EEFf40c1DF396c172) so that voting will happen on the Avalanche network.\n\nThe payload executed will just contain an empty `execute()` function, as the purpose of this fire drill is testing the full flow, and not any execution content.\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV3Avalanche](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/12b567e8939bbd8297d73225fae9b5a6a4e0d5ec/src/20250530_AaveV3Avalanche_TestVoteOnAvalanche/AaveV3Avalanche_TestVoteOnAvalanche_20250530.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV3Avalanche](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/12b567e8939bbd8297d73225fae9b5a6a4e0d5ec/src/20250530_AaveV3Avalanche_TestVoteOnAvalanche/AaveV3Avalanche_TestVoteOnAvalanche_20250530.t.sol)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/technical-maintenance-proposals/15274/92)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
