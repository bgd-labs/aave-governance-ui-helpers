The risk parameters detailed within have been provided by Gauntlet. \n\n## Abstract\n\n1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol v1. The 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space.\n\nListing 1INCH on Aave v2 will enable lenders to receive yield and borrowers of 1INCH to partake in 1inch’s tokenomics to vote and be reimbursed their gas cost to perform swaps on 1inch’s Aggregation Platform.\n\n## Motivation\n\nListing 1INCH on the Aave v2 market would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage and recognise the efforts of the 1inch team for being supportive of Aave since before v1.  \n\nSince the original proposal to list 1INCH the team has removed minting roles on the token, introduced a progressive vesting schedule and created use cases for aTokens. The 1INCH token is supported by a Chainlink oracle feed and has favourable on-chain liquidity conditions.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal initializes the 1INCH reserve, enables variable borrowing, sets a reserve factor and configures the reserve as collateral. As needed, it also connects a price source on the AaveOracle.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nAll the components involved in this proposal (tokens' implementations, interest rate strategy, oracle feed, proposal payload) have been tested and reviewed, including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\nLink to Test Cases: [End-to-end test suite](https://github.com/defijesus/bdg-labs-aave-v2-listings/blob/master/src/test/Validation1InchListing.sol), [aToken/stableDebtToken/variableDebtToken verification](https://github.com/defijesus/bdg-labs-aave-v2-listings/tree/master/diffs), [deployment script](https://github.com/defijesus/bdg-labs-aave-v2-listings/blob/master/scripts/1InchListingPayload.s.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\nWe recommend the following risk parameters.\n\n### Risk Parameters:\n\nLTV 40%\n\nLiquidation Threshold 50%\n\nLiquidation Bonus 8.5%\n\nReserve Factor 20%\n\n### Variable Interest Rate Parameters:\n\nUOptimal 45%\n\nR_0 0%\n\nR_s1 7%\n\nR_s2 300%\n\n\nThe snapshot vote to add 1INCH on Aave v2 mainnet market can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2ea76814a0dfcad7ea1a7b3c597f059a8d574f8143886b23043918998505f5a7).  \n\n\n- [ProposalPayload](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd417d07c20e31f6e129fa68182054b641fbec8bd#code)\n- [aINCH implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x130FBED7dBA2b370f0F93b0Caea2cfD9b811D66D#code)\n- [Variable Debt 1INCH implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4d3707566Ee8a0ed6DE424a262050C7587da8152#code)\n- [Stable Debt 1INCH implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9C2114Bf70774C36E9b8d6c790c9C14FF0d6799E#code)\n- [Interest rate strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2eD1eCE1c13455Ce9299d35D3B00358529f3Dc8#code) \n- [1INCH/ETH price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8#code)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)."},"proposal":{"id":54,"votingDuration":600,"creationTime":1699959228,"accessLevel":1,"basicState":5,"queuingTime":0,"ipfsHash":"0x12f2d9c91e4e23ae4009ab9ef5862ee0ae79498937b66252213221f04a5d5b32","initialPayloads":[{"id":68,"chainId":5,"payloadsController":"0x064361B3761CcDd17300146bf58a79d1E570382E"}],"snapshotBlockHash":"0x880281811593f1cb24c5dd2dc1406e3087d4de1366cbe3fc9c0a39c5539fe803","creator":"0xAd9A211D227d2D9c1B5573f73CDa0284b758Ac0C","canceledAt":0,"votingActivationTime":1699959876,"votingChainId":5,"votingMachineData":{"id":54,"forVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","startTime":1699959972,"endTime":1699960572,"votingClosedAndSentBlockNumber":10041779,"votingClosedAndSentTimestamp":1699960608,"l1BlockHash":"0x880281811593f1cb24c5dd2dc1406e3087d4de1366cbe3fc9c0a39c5539fe803","strategy":"0x2e5a80Be4EA93225f0D9bFE1f8aC6470f54acDb9","sentToGovernance":true,"createdBlock":10041740,"votedInfo":{"support":false,"votingPower":"0"},"votingAssets":["0xb6D88BfC5b145a558b279cf7692e6F02064889d0","0x1406A9Ea2B0ec8FD4bCa4F876DAae2a70a9856Ec","0xD1ff82609FB63A0eee6FE7D2896d80d29491cCCd"],"hasRequiredRoots":true},"prerender":true}}
